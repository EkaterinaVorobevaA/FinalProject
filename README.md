# Travel Planner

An intelligent, menu-driven Python application that helps users sort and select travel options based on budget, duration, and logic-based filters.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

This project was created as part of a semester-long assignment to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming, algorithms, logical expression parsing, and performance analysis. It simulates a real-world travel assistant that suggests, filters, and sorts travel routes based on user-defined conditions.

### ðŸ”§ Goals:

- Allow users to load travel data and sort it by budget or duration.
- Support logical conditions using truth tables (e.g., `p âˆ§ q`).
- Provide search functionality by city name.
- Compare performance between loop-based and recursive algorithms.
- Offer a user-friendly console menu.

## ðŸ›  Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `.zip`:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/travel-planner.git
2. Install dependencies:
    pip install pandas matplotlib
3. Run Jupyter Notebook:
    jupyter notebook
Make sure trips.csv is in the root directory.

Usage

1. Open Travel_Planner_Project.ipynb.
2. Execute all cells.
3. Use the menu:
    1. Sort by budget + logic (loop)
    2. Sort by duration + logic (recursion)
    3. Search trip by city name
    4. Save last sorted trips to CSV
    5. Compare performance of sorting algorithms
    6. Exit
    
Enter city name like Rome or Tokyo.
All data is read from trips.csv.
